## Probability and Stochastic Processes

Master's of Research (MRes) course, [https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/](STORi), School of Mathematical Sciences, Lancaster University.


The module provides an introduction to probability, random variables, 
Poisson processes and a range of key stochastic processes for modelling in statistics 
and operational research. The emphasis in the module is on the 
evaluation of complex stochastic properties via both analytical methods and simulation.

2024 - Present.

## Modelling Multilevel and Longitudinal Data

MSc in Statistics course, [https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/postgraduate-courses/statistics-msc/2024/](MSc Stat), School of Mathematical Sciences, Lancaster University. 

The module provides methods and computational skills to model 
common dependence structures seen in hierarchical data, 
including longitudinal and multi-level data. 

2022 - Present.
