## My research interest
My primary research interests lie in developing novel statistical methodologies 
for analyzing 

1. Large-scale and complex time series.
1. Large spatio-temporal data. 
1. Nonstationary time series data
1. Functional data and continuous processes
1. Methodologies for Point Processes

I am highly motivated by real world problems such as data from Environment, 
Energy, Health, and Engineering.

If you are **interested in pursuing a PhD** in any (or related) of the above 
topics, please contact me.
